        <p>Welcome! I'm starting this blog to share some of the lessons I've learned while running my agency. Whether you're thinking about starting your own business or already running one, I hope you'll find something useful here.</p>
        <p>I'll be writing about the real challenges, the unexpected wins, and the things I wish someone had told me when I was getting started. No fluff - just practical insights from the trenches.</p>

        <h2>The One Thing I Wish I'd Known Before Starting</h2>
        <p><em>Posted: August 5, 2025</em></p>
        <p>If I could go back and tell myself one thing before starting my agency, it would be this: your first client probably won't be your ideal client, and that's perfectly okay.</p>
        <p>I spent months trying to land what I thought was the "perfect" client - the right industry, the right budget, the right everything. Meanwhile, I turned down smaller opportunities that didn't fit my grand vision.</p>
        <p>What I learned: those "imperfect" early clients taught me more about running a business than any course or blog post ever could. They helped me refine my processes, understand what I actually enjoyed doing, and most importantly - they paid the bills while I figured things out.</p>
        <p>Your business will evolve. Your ideal client will evolve. Don't let perfect be the enemy of getting started.</p>

        <h2>Three Questions That Changed How I Price My Services</h2>
        <p><em>Posted: August 1, 2025</em></p>
        <p>Pricing was the scariest part of starting my agency. I had no idea what to charge and was terrified of losing clients by asking for "too much."</p>
        <p>Then a mentor asked me three simple questions that completely shifted my perspective:</p>
        <p><strong>1. What's the cost of you NOT doing this work for them?</strong><br>
        This helped me think about value instead of just time. If my work saves them money or makes them money, my fee should reflect that impact.</p>
        <p><strong>2. What would it cost them to hire someone full-time to do this?</strong><br>
        Suddenly my rates didn't seem so expensive when compared to a full-time salary plus benefits.</p>
        <p><strong>3. What's the worst that happens if they say no?</strong><br>
        Usually? Nothing. I move on to the next prospect. The fear was bigger than the actual risk.</p>
        <p>These questions helped me price with confidence instead of fear. Game changer.</p>

        <h2>The System That Saved My Sanity</h2>
        <p><em>Posted: July 28, 2025</em></p>
        <p>Six months into running my agency, I was drowning. I was working 70-hour weeks, constantly stressed about deadlines, and starting to wonder if I'd made a huge mistake.</p>
        <p>The problem wasn't the workload - it was that I had no systems. Everything was reactive. Every client request felt urgent because I had no way to track what was actually urgent versus what just felt that way.</p>
        <p>Here's the simple system that changed everything:</p>
        <p><strong>Monday Morning Planning:</strong> 30 minutes to review all projects and set the week's priorities.</p>
        <p><strong>Daily Check-ins:</strong> 10 minutes at the end of each day to update project status and plan tomorrow.</p>
        <p><strong>Client Communication Schedule:</strong> Set days for client updates instead of responding to every email immediately.</p>
        <p>It sounds basic, but having predictable rhythms transformed my business from chaos to calm. I went from feeling like I was always behind to feeling in control of my schedule.</p>
        <p>The best part? Clients noticed the difference too. When you're organized, it shows in your work quality.</p>
