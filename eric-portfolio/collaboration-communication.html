                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Product decisions were being made based on incomplete mental models rather than true understanding of user behavior. Teams were responding to surface-level requests like “make things look nice” instead of addressing real problems coaches experienced. Nobody fully understood the complex coach experience.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>I took ownership of mapping the entire coach experience, facilitating weekly collaborative sessions with product managers to build shared understanding. This wasn’t traditional research - it was facilitative leadership through organizational complexity, making a mess together until patterns emerged.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>Through persistent weekly sessions, we created a comprehensive coach experience sitemap that became the foundational document for all subsequent product decisions. The systematic understanding shifted focus from reactive design requests to strategic problem-solving.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>The sitemap became referenced for every coach portfolio product decision going forward. This work was significant enough that it earned my promotion to Senior Designer - proving that sometimes the most valuable design happens before any interfaces are created.</p>
