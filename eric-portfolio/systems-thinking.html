            <section class="section">
                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Leadership requested new coach business programs every quarter, but our team took 4 months to build each one (that’s -1 month per cycle ☠️). Every request started from scratch — new designs, new development, new bottlenecks. After three cycles, I recognized this pattern: all programs shared the same core structure (timelines, rank requirements, performance thresholds) but we were treating each as a unique project.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>Rather than taking orders blindly, I interviewed product managers and stakeholders to understand the root problem. I proposed building a flexible system that could accommodate future programs without custom development. We iterated until we had a solution that worked.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>By identifying the underlying pattern across all programs, I designed one flexible system instead of many one-off solutions. I designed a modular program framework that abstracted the common elements while allowing customization of specific requirements. This covered all historical program types and could adapt to new variations, turning what had been custom builds into configuration.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>Development cycles dropped from 4 months to 2-3 weeks. Design time went from weeks to days. Leadership could deliver incentive details to coaches on schedule to their hearts’ content, and the team shifted from reactive, urgent frustration to proactive, important problem-solving.</p>
