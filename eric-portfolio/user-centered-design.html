                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>"I will take money from whoever wants to give it to me." — Every home service business owner, ever.</p>
                <p>This quote from a discovery workshop captures how most small business owners tend to think about their customers — as transactions rather than people. Through research with our own clients (small business owners), we discovered nearly everyone was requesting more leads, more volume, more work, rather than considering what people really needed, resulting in unqualified leads and wasted dollars.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>We conducted structured discovery workshops with clients to understand how they think about the people they serve. The pattern was clear: they were making assumptions about what their potential customers wanted rather than thinking about them the way they talked about their current and past relationships.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>We developed a Target Customer Profile framework that required defining user motivations, pain points, and decision criteria. This shifted how clients thought about their audience and became the foundation for all campaign strategy, ensuring every message spoke to real human needs rather than generic assumptions and that the decisions made were for customers rather than our clients themselves.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>Lead quality improved dramatically, clients spent less on ineffective outreach, we were better aligned internally, and campaigns resonated because they were designed around actual user thoughts and behaviors.</p>
