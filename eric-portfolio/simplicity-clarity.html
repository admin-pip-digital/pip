                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>Optavia’s behavior change program was proven effective through thousands of transformations, but it was locked in two 400-page textbooks that nobody read. Market research revealed a $1.5M/month opportunity if we could make the content accessible.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Approach</h2>
                <p>We conducted focus groups with coaches through the Scientific & Clinical Affairs team and discovered they were already creating workarounds - sending abridged digital versions to clients. Rather than digitizing everything, we focused on what coaches and clients actually needed: flexible access to the content in formats that fit their lives.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section class="section">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>We tested multiple formats (chatbot, podcasts, digital reading experience) and found the audio and e-book experience resonated most strongly. We designed an accessible resource library that let users consume 800 pages of dense content in manageable, context-appropriate ways - reading chapters when focused, listening while commuting.</p>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>Adoption of the program increased significantly. Coaches stopped building their own unofficial materials and could focus on coaching. Years of requests for an official digital version were finally resolved through a solution that made complexity feel effortless.</p>
