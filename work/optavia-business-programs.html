        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Leadership requested new coach business programs every 3 months, but our team was taking 4 months to build one. Every person was already behind by the time they were told what to do, leadership was (obviously) frustrated, and the product management team was stuck in endless meetings trying to figure out what to do. After experiencing 3 of these cycles firsthand, I started to pick up on a few patterns the business programs shared: Time-bound challenges with rank-based requirements and each request started from scratch, creating bottlenecks and team tension.</p>

    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>I interviewed product managers and company stakeholders and gathered the information needed to understand what was going on, then analyzed the requirements from my interviews as well as what I could learn about previous program requests and identified the underlying system.</p>
        <p>All programs shared the same core variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Timelines</li>
            <li>Monthly requirements</li>
            <li>Rank-based qualification criteria</li>
            <li>Performance thresholds</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <p>Instead of designing another one-off solution, I proposed building a flexible system that could accommodate future programs. I worked with the product management team to build a case for this approach and presented it to leadership.</p>

    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>I designed a modular program framework that abstracted the common elements while allowing for customization of specific requirements. This covered all historical program types and could adapt to new variations without custom development.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>This system reduced the 4-month development cycle to 3 weeks. Leadership requests could actually be delivered on time, and details about incentives for coaches were delivered within the time they needed to prepare their teams.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Freed up product management from repetitive scoping meetings</li>
            <li>Changed team dynamic from reactive frustration to proactive problem-solving</li>
            <li>Regularly high performance from myself and others earned our design team a reputation for reliable execution</li>
        </ul>
    </div>  
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Why This Worked</h2>
        <p>Instead of treating each business program request as a unique design challenge, I recognized it as an organizational problem that needed a systematic solution. Sometimes the best design work happens behind the scenes beyond the high tension emotions and drama - I used critical/systems thinking to identify the root cause and solved the real problem rather than just continuing to deliver what was requested.</p>
