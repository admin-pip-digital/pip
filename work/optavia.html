            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>We designed and developed a landing page for a health & wellness company’s new client-led acquisition channel. The page was tested head-to-head against one created by an external agency partner.</p>

                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>A health and wellness company wanted to add direct client acquisition channels through marketing campaigns (ads + landing pages) that could both educate and convert prospects</p>
