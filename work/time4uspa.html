            <p>We designed and developed a landing page for a local spa. The page was launched simultaneously with an ad campaign to gain attention for their grand opening.</p>

            <p>We spent time in the beginning to deep dive with the owner to understand his business and goals. This is an important step to make sure we are strategizing with your needs and your budget and not applying a one-size-fits all solution.</p>
            <p>We then defined everything that business needed (including an audit on the customer experience) and scaled down to what would make the biggest impact now in the shortest amount of time.</p>
