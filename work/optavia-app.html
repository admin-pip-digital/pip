        <h1>From 2 to 4.7 Stars: The Impact of Truly Understanding your Users</h1>

        <h2>Project brief</h2>
        <p>Optavia's mobile app was struggling with fundamental usability and strategic issues. The product had been outsourced multiple times, resulting in inconsistent components and conflicting design directions. Without clear product direction, the app was built around misguided assumptions about user needs, operating more like an e-commerce platform than a health support tool. This disconnect led to poor app store ratings and low adoption rates among Optavia's clients.</p>

        <h2>Our focus was on understanding the true relationship between Optavia's coaches and clients, then translating those insights into a coherent product vision.</h2>
        <p>To understand the real user needs, we took a comprehensive approach to studying the business ecosystem. We conducted in-depth interviews with both clients and coaches, analyzed existing business materials, and observed actual client-coach interactions in their natural context. This research revealed that the current app fundamentally misunderstood how Optavia's program actually worked.</p>
        <p>Through this process, we developed key deliverables including a detailed client journey map and comprehensive user needs documentation. These became living documents that evolved continuously as we gained deeper insights into the user experience.</p>

        <h2>The app needed to be a companion for behavior change, not a shopping platform.</h2>
        <p>Our research uncovered critical insights that reshaped our entire approach. The coach-client relationship was far more central to success than we initially understood, with clients being heavily dependent on their coaches for guidance and motivation. More importantly, we discovered that clients needed support in adopting the broader "Optavia lifestyle" rather than simply browsing and purchasing products. The app needed to be a companion for behavior change, not a shopping platform.</p>

        <p>By shifting focus from e-commerce to habit support, we created a product that better served Optavia's unique business model and user needs. The success of the habit tracking features validated our research insights and established a foundation for continued product evolution.</p>
