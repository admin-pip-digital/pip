        <h1>SimpleNexus Agent Experience</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Business challenge</h2>
        <p>After establishing SimpleNexus as a market leader in digital mortgage solutions for lenders, the company identified a strategic opportunity to expand its ecosystem to include real estate agents—key partners in the mortgage process. As Design Lead, I was tasked with introducing this new user persona to the platform, creating value for agents while strengthening our core lender offering through improved collaboration.</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Market & user research</h2>
        <p>I approached this ecosystem expansion with methodical research to ensure we built for genuine needs rather than assumptions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Immersive Learning: I enrolled in real estate licensing courses to understand the agent's professional landscape, regulatory requirements, and day-to-day workflows.</li>
            <li>Direct Engagement: Adapting to pandemic constraints, I conducted remote interviews with practicing agents across markets, visiting open houses when possible to observe agents in their natural environment.</li>
            <li>Pattern Identification: Through systematic analysis of research findings, I identified critical communication gaps between agents, lenders, and buyers that presented high-value opportunities for digital intervention.</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Strategic framework development</h2>
        <p>After synthesizing research insights, I proposed using the Google Ventures Design Sprint methodology to rapidly validate our opportunity hypothesis. I secured executive support for this approach by demonstrating how it would:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accelerate time-to-insight with minimal resource investment</li>
            <li>Align cross-functional stakeholders through collaborative problem-solving</li>
            <li>Produce testable solutions within one week</li>
            <li>Validate market fit before significant development investment</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Design sprint leadership</h2>
        <p>I led the cross-functional team (Product, Engineering, Design) through a structured five-day sprint process, carefully adapting the methodology to address our specific business and user goals</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-image-block">

    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Day one: Alignment & Definition</h2>
        <p>I facilitated sessions that established clear success metrics, balancing agent needs with lender satisfaction. We created a comprehensive ecoysystem map showing the relationships between different users and got stakeholder input along the way to ensure we were following regulatory requirements and mortgage industry nuances. We decided to focus on pre-qualification letters, one of the highest-impact moments in the agent/lender relationship that we could influence.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Day two: Divergent Exploration</h2>
        <p>I guided the team through structured ideation techniques that helped us explore different possibilities. We dove into competitive analysis of existing solutions in adjacent markets to see what was already out there, then moved into structured sketching exercises that generated a wide variety of solution approaches. We wrapped up with group critique sessions where we could identify the most promising patterns emerging across all our concepts.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Day three: Solution Convergence</h2>
        <p>On the third day, we brought our ideas back together and used dot-voting to pinpoint the most promising features across different concepts. This helped us build consensus around the core functionality we wanted to prioritize: clear pre-qualification amount visualization, borrower-friendly letter generation, agent-controlled parameter settings, and seamless sharing capabilities. Working together through this process, I was able to create a comprehensive storyboard that mapped out the complete user journey and highlighted all the key interactions throughout the system.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Day Four: Prototype Development</h2>
        <p>On day four, we moved into prototype development, and I personally crafted a high-fidelity interactive prototype that brought our ideas to life. The prototype simulated the core functionality so we could conduct realistic user testing, while maintaining visual consistency with the existing SimpleNexus ecosystem. Throughout the development process, I made sure we were addressing the key needs of agents while also preserving those important lender relationships.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Day five: User Validation</h2>
        <p>I co-facilitated user testing sessions with four real estate agents, working systematically to gather meaningful insights. We carefully observed user reactions and recorded their feedback throughout the sessions, which helped us identify key improvement opportunities. The testing allowed us to validate our core value proposition and gave us confidence in our direction. What was particularly exciting was documenting the enthusiastic reactions agents had to the solution concept – it was clear we were onto something that would genuinely help them in their work.</p>

        <h2>Strategic Insights & Solution Design</h2>
        <p>The sprint validated our hypothesis that agents faced significant friction in the pre-qualification process. Building on this foundation, I developed a comprehensive design strategy for the full agent experience:</p>

        <p>I designed a seamless agent experience that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leveraged SimpleNexus's unique position as a holder of lender data for approximately 1 in 7 US mortgage transactions</li>
            <li>Created transparency between agents and lenders throughout the transaction lifecycle</li>
            <li>Maintained appropriate data boundaries while improving cross-functional collaboration</li>

        <h2>Implementation & Collaboration</h2>
        <p>I worked hand-in-hand with engineering throughout the development process, creating detailed component specifications and conducting regular design reviews to keep everything on track. I provided ongoing guidance on interaction patterns and edge cases while making sure we stayed consistent with SimpleNexus design standards.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Business Impact</h2>
        <p>The agent experience we designed made a real difference for the business. We successfully brought real estate agents into the SimpleNexus ecosystem as a new user segment, which expanded our market reach while also strengthening our core lender offering by improving how they collaborate with their key partners. The solution showed our product's adaptability as we adjusted features when the market shifted from the hot 2021 environment to more normalized conditions. It also set us up for future growth through features like home search and integration with other mortgage technologies.</p>

    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
        <p>This project really highlighted how powerful a structured design approach can be when you're entering new markets. By sticking to a disciplined research and validation process, we managed to expand the SimpleNexus ecosystem while actually making things better for our existing users. The Design Sprint gave us an efficient way to manage risk and get valuable insights quickly on what was ultimately a pretty strategic business move.</p>
