        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>SimpleNexus dominated digital mortgage solutions for lenders but was missing a key opportunity - real estate agents who influence which lenders their buyers work with. How do you expand into a new user base without disrupting your core business?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article">

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>I immersed myself in the real estate world - took licensing courses, interviewed agents, visited open houses. The key insight: agents and lenders had a communication breakdown around pre-qualification letters that hurt everyone involved.</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>I led a 5-day design sprint that resulted in an agent dashboard where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Agents could generate pre-qual letters with borrower-friendly language</li>
            <li>Parameters stayed within lender guidelines but gave agents control</li>
            <li>Borrowers could self-serve updates within agent-defined limits</li>
            <li>Everyone stayed informed as loan conditions changed</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Successfully brought a new user segment into the SimpleNexus ecosystem while strengthening relationships between our existing lender clients and their agent partners. The solution adapted well when market conditions shifted in 2022.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Why This Worked</h2>
        <p>Instead of building what we assumed agents needed, we validated the core problem first. The design sprint let us test our hypothesis quickly before committing significant development resources. Sometimes the best way to grow your product is to solve problems for people adjacent to your current users.</p>
