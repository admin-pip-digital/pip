        <h1>Building Shared Understanding: Mapping the Optavia Experience</h1>
        <p>How we "drew the bigger picture" together as a team and prevented future assumption-based product work</p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>When I joined the team, the coach experience at Optavia was more complex and nuanced than anyone fully understood. Product decisions were being made based on incomplete mental models rather than true understanding of user behavior. People tip-toed around and avoided the parts of the product that were messy and imperfect, so I stepped in to take a look and get to work. Teams were responding to surface-level requests to “make things look nice” or do what leadership intuitively “thought would work” instead of addressing the real problems coaches were experiencing.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>I took ownership of mapping the entire coach experience as part of a larger company-wide user journey initiative. Working with the coach portfolio product managers, I facilitated weekly collaborative sessions to build shared and deep understanding of the coach journey map.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>This wasn’t traditional user research — it was facilitative leadership of a complex organizational challenge. It’s what you might call ”organizing the messy middle.”</p>
        <p>Together with the design team and product managers, we designed a collaborative process where stakeholders could work through complexity together and see the bigger picture, building shared understanding rather than just documentation. The sessions involved making a mess, getting everything out, and reorganizing it together until patterns emerged.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Persistence Factor</h2>
        <p>This is the kind of work that feels like walking through a dark forest, wondering if you’ll ever come out the other side until you are finally see the sunlight. I kept bringing the team back to the same discussion week after week, even when progress felt slow or unclear, until we finally reached a coherent structure that fit the entire coach experience.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Impact</h2>
        <p>Our teams created a comprehensive artifact that outlined the entire Optavia user experience. I made a coach experience sitemap that became the foundational document referenced for all subsequent product decisions in the coach portfolio. This systematic understanding shifted focus from reactive design requests to strategic problem-solving based on real needs. The work was significant enough that it earned my personal promotion to Senior Designer.</p>

    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Why This Worked</h2>
        <p>Sometimes the most valuable design work happens before any interfaces are created. By persisting through the ambiguity to build genuine organizational understanding, we created a reliable and sturdy foundation for all future strategic decisions.</p>
