        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Our agency needed to compete with larger firms for premium clients. The existing brand looked like every other small marketing agency - generic and forgettable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>We designed a bold visual system that would make potential clients stop and take notice. The key insight: businesses hire agencies they perceive as successful, so the brand needed to project confidence and capability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-image-block">

Same dramatic photo of woman on exercise bike visible below fold. Notebook and Apple mouse visible on des">
        <img src="../assets/image/epic-marketing-3.png" alt="Four iPhone screens showing Epic website navigation flow: blog article about design, homepage with exercise bike hero image and '01/05 HIGHLIGHT REEL' card promoting client work, careers page showing Graphic Designer job posting on yellow with X close button, and article detail page with typography and topic selection interface">

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>High-contrast black and yellow color system that stands out in a sea of safe blues and grays</li>
            <li>Modular layout system that works across mobile and desktop</li>
            <li>Typography hierarchy that makes content scannable</li>
            <li>Interactive elements that make users feel "part of something special"</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="article-image-block">
        <img src="../assets/image/epic-marketing-7.png" alt="Two desktop website pages: left shows Design services page with heading 'Problem solving since forever' with yellow accent blocks highlighting text, sections for 'The purpose of good design' and 'What makes it worth it?', plus expandable service categories (Identity, Environmental Graphics, Web Design); right shows team page 'Meet the team' with grid of black and white employee photos, some overlaid on yellow blocks with seasonal labels (Summer, Jared) and X close buttons, plus recruitment message about finding passionate people">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The rebrand positioned Epic to win larger accounts and move into a branded office space that reinforces the premium positioning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-image-block">
        <img src="../assets/image/epic-marketing-8.png" alt="Three iPhone screens showing Epic website: Design services detail page with yellow text highlight and section about design purpose, homepage with Highlight Reel card (01/05) showing exercise bike photo, and Contact page titled 'Get in touch' with contact information (info@marketingepic.com, Draper Utah address, phone/fax), filled form showing name, email, and phone number">
        <img src="../assets/image/epic-marketing-9.png" alt="Three iPhone screens: careers page showing yellow Graphic Designer job posting with Summer employee photo and recruitment message, services overview page with Strategy and Design columns listing offerings (Brand Strategy/Identity, Market Research, Environmental, Planning, Web Design, Media Buying), and portfolio page titled 'Some work we've done' with filter tabs (EVERYTHING selected, SORT BY CLIENT, MOST RECENT, ALPHABETICAL) showing VASA Fitness Studio Brand Identity project card">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Why This Worked</h2>
        <p>Sometimes you have to be willing to polarize to stand out. The bold design attracts clients who value creativity and confidence while filtering out those looking for the cheapest option. Better to be someone's strong yes than everyone's maybe.</p>
