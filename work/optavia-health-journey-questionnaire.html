        <h2>Business Challenge</h2>
        <p>Optavia needed to transform its coach-dependent acquisition model to create a scalable direct-to-consumer pathway. As the lead designer, I was tasked with creating a frictionless onboarding experience that would properly set user expectations, match them with appropriate health solutions, and maintain the coach relationship that drives the company's success.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-image-block">
        <img src="../assets/image/optavia-questionnaire-1.avif">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Strategic approach</h2>
        <p>I led the design strategy for the health journey questionnaire—a critical touchpoint that serves both as the first product experience for new users and as a powerful business tool that routes users to appropriate solutions while supporting our coach network.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-image-block">
        <img src="../assets/image/optavia-questionnaire-2.avif">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Research-Driven Design</h2>
        <p>Working closely with our marketing team, I conducted competitive analysis of health onboarding experiences and analyzed user entry points to understand their mindset and expectations. This revealed that users arrived with limited program knowledge but high motivation to make health changes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-image-block">
        <img src="../assets/image/optavia-questionnaire-3.avif">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Cross-functional collaboration</h2>
        <p>I facilitated workshops with program experts, marketing teams, and coaches to align on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Key health information needed to route users appropriately</li>
            <li>Critical education moments within the questionnaire</li>
            <li>Seamless handoff points to coaches or specialized solutions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This collaboration ensured our solution met business objectives while supporting all user groups—including those with specialized health needs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Design solutions</h2>
        <p>Clients with unique needs</p>
        <p>I designed an adaptive questionnaire system that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Captures user health goals and constraints</li>
            <li>Identifies specialized needs (e.g. diabetes, weight loss, medication integration)</li>
            <li>Recommends appropriate plans based on individual profiles</li>
            <li>Maintains compliance with health guidelines for user safety</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <img src="../assets/image/optavia-questionnaire-4.avif">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Specialized health need integration</h2>
        <p>For users with complex requirements, I developed branching pathways that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and route diabetic users to compatible plans</li>
            <li>Integrate with LifeMD for weight loss medication evaluation</li>
            <li>Preserve coach relationships throughout specialized care journeys</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The LifeMD integration required careful UX consideration to maintain a cohesive experience while meeting regulatory requirements across platforms. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Coach-client connection system</h2>
        <p>To protect OPTAVIA's unique coach model, I designed a system that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alerts coaches when new clients join through the direct channel</li>
            <li>Provides coaches with visibility into client health profiles</li>
            <li>Creates natural touchpoints for coaches to engage with new clients</li>
            <li>Allows clients to connect with coaches at any point in their journey</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Implementation & collaboration</h2>
        <p>I partnered closely with our engineering team throughout development, delivering comprhensive component documentation, interactive prototypes for complex user flows, detailed state documentation, and regular QA through implementation.</p>

    <div class="article-image-block">
        <img src="../assets/image/optavia-questionnaire-6.avif">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>User pathways</h2>
        <p>The intricate branching logic required detailed mapping of user journeys. I created a comprehensive decision tree that accounted for all potential user profiles and health needs. This mapping became a critical reference tool for both product and engineering teams throughout implementation.</p>

        <h2>Results & impact</h2>
        <p>The health journey questionnaire transformed Optavia's client acquisition approach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client Experience: New users now receive personalized program recommendations tailored to their health needs, setting proper expectations and improving early engagement.</li>
            <li>Coach Experience: Coaches report higher-quality client interactions with better-prepared leads who understand program fundamentals.</li>
            <li>Business Impact: The direct acquisition channel now successfully routes users to appropriate solutions while maintaining the coach realtionship model that drives Optavia's success.</li>
            <li>Healthcare Integration: The LifeMD partnership pathway expanded Optavia's ability to support clients interested in weight loss medication, opening a new market segment while maintaining program integrity.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Key learnings</h2>
        <p>This project reinforced the importance of balancing business objectives with user needs in complex health products. The careful balance we achieved between direct acquisition, coach support, and specialized health routing demonstrates how thoughtful design can support multiple business initiatives simultaneously.</p>
