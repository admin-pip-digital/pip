        <h1>Optavia health journey questionnaire</h1>

        <img src="../assets/image/optavia-questionnaire-hero.avif" alt="Hand holding iPhone displaying Optavia health journey personalization questionnaire with the question 'What is your goal?' and three selectable options: Lose weight, Build healthy habits, and Build muscle, with a blue Next button at the bottom">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Optavia's coach-dependent acquisition model couldn't scale. New users arrived motivated but confused about which health program fit their needs, creating a bottleneck that limited growth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-image-block">
        <img src="../assets/image/optavia-questionnaire-7.avif" alt="Comprehensive user flow diagram showing the complete Optavia health journey questionnaire logic, including decision trees for goal selection (lose weight, gain weight, maintain weight), age brackets, exercise habits, GLP-1 medication usage, and plan routing logic that branches users into different program versions (V1, V2/V3, V3/V3) based on their responses, with color-coded nodes indicating different plan types and user segments">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The approach</h2>
        <p>We designed a smart questionnaire that does two things at once: educates users about their options while gathering the information needed to route them properly. The key insight was that people don't just need a program recommendation - they need to understand why it's right for them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-image-block">
        <img src="../assets/image/optavia-questionnaire-1.avif" alt="Three mobile screens showing Optavia's personalized onboarding flow: first screen asking 'What is your goal?' with options including Learn healthy habits (selected), second screen asking about current exercise habits with three intensity options, and third screen showing a loading state with the Optavia sunburst logo and text 'One moment while we put together your plan">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>An adaptive questionnaire system that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Starts broad (goals, exercise habits) then gets specific based on responses</li>
            <li>Identifies specialized needs (diabetes, pregnancy, medication compatibility)</li>
            <li>Routes users to appropriate programs while preserving coach relationships</li>
            <li>Seamlessly hands off to LifeMD for weight loss medication when relevant</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="article-image-block">
        <img src="../assets/image/optavia-questionnaire-2.avif" alt="Three screens showing plan selection process: initial goal selection screen, modal displaying Optimal Weight 5 & 1 ACTIVE Plan with meal icons and details about weight loss goals and exercise requirements, and final plan summary screen showing assigned coach, community access, guide book, app availability, and 5 & 1 ACTIVE meal plan with daily requirements and auto-renewal options">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Why This Worked</h2>
        <p>The branching logic (shown in the flow diagram) handles dozens of user scenarios while feeling simple. Users get personalized recommendations that make sense to them, coaches get better-prepared leads, and the business opened new pathways without losing what made them successful.</p>
