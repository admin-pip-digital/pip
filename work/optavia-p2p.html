        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>User research was done by the Director of UX (my boss) to investigate a decline in coach performance. I assisted with interviewing some of the 20 coaches, then he analyzed results and compiled recommendations that were presented to leadership and used to make a strategic decision.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>Optavia's coaches had saturated their personal networks. They'd successfully grown their client bases by selling to friends, family, and connections - but there was nowhere left to expand. The business model that got them this far couldn't scale further. User research led by our UX director revealed the core issue: coaches needed access to clients beyond their existing networks, and potential clients existed who wanted the program but had no coach connection.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-image-block">
        <img src="../assets/image/optavia-path-to-purchase-1.png" alt="Three clickable cards showing Optavia's turnkey nutrition plans for different journey stages: Weight Loss card with person in home on phone (Achieve a healthy weight), GLP-1 Support card with woman at laptop (Get proper nutrition and muscle health support while on weight loss medication), and Maintenance card with three people jogging outdoors (Support a healthy weight)">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Strategic Shift</h2>
        <p>Leadership decided to pivot from coach-dependent acquisition to company-led marketing. Instead of relying solely on coaches to find clients, Optavia would use marketing and a set of new user pathways to connect strangers with coaches and allow clients to self-initiate their health journey. This was fundamental restructuring - we were building a new front door to the business.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>I owned the entire client experience for this new acquisition model across web, marketing, e-commerce, and the mobile app. The central design challenge was creating a "goal-to-plan" questionnaire system that would:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Help clients understand which program fit their needs</li>
            <li>Match them with appropriate coaches</li>
            <li>Enable self-service purchasing while preserving the coach relationship</li>
            <li>Scale beyond what individual coach networks could reach</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>Working collaboratively with the marketing, nutrition, legal, and development teams, I designed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use case mapping for different client types (weight loss, GLP-1 support, maintenance, athletic performance)</li>
            <li>User pathways from initial awareness through coach connection and first purchase</li>
            <li>Questionnaire logic that educated users while gathering data for appropriate routing</li>
            <li>Technical strategy to support coach matching and program recommendations</li>
            <li>Systematic solutions that could adapt as new programs and user needs emerged</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Execution Reality</h2>
        <p>This happened during significant industry disruption (GLP-1 medications changing the weight loss landscape). The complexity wasn't just the design - it was aligning cross-functional teams around a fundamental business model change while market conditions were shifting under us. We built and launched despite the uncertainty.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Impact</h2>
        <p>By designing pathways for clients to find coaches independently rather than just improving existing coach tools, we unlocked markets that individual networks could never reach. This wasn't just UX work - it was business model design. The systematic approach enabled Optavia to adapt as both user needs and unpredictable market conditions (GLP-1 disruption) continued to evolve.</p>
