        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>A wellness company needed a landing page that could both educate prospects and drive conversions. They were testing our internal approach against an external agency's work.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>We focused on user needs over visual flourishes - clear navigation, straightforward journey mapping, and reducing friction in the conversion flow. The external agency went heavy on brand styling; we prioritized usability.</p>

    <div class="article-image-block">

HELLO, AFTER-THE-AFTER.' in white and gradient purple, with message about committing to transforming your body">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>Simplified user flow that matched how people actually wanted to engage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear entry points (login, start journey, find coach)</li>
            <li>Streamlined information architecture</li>
            <li>Mobile-first responsive design</li>
            <li>Faster load times through cleaner code</li>

Secondary paths show connect with a coach leading to lead form, or search for coach by name. All paths converge to cart with correct items for user's goal">
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Head-to-head testing over one month:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>22% higher conversion rate</li>
            <li>7% better engagement</li>
            <li>6% lower bounce rate</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="article-text-block">
        <h2>Why This Worked</h2>
        <p>When users can accomplish their goals easily, they convert better. The agency focused on looking impressive; We focused on removing barriers. Sometimes the best design is the one users don't have to think about.</p>
